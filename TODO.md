  RECIPE APP: CKBK condensed for cookbook

  List is shown in prioritized order:
  (7) ability to select and delete multiple items using a checkbox for each individual item
  (3) highlight recipe ingredient names when hovered over change each text to blue
  (4) Recipe categories in Nav-bar or the hamburger stack (i.e. breakfast, lunch, dinner,  )
  (9) fix the layout by adding styling and positioning for elements on the page.
  (7) time stamps (moment.js) or (timeago.js)
  (3) delete recipe ingredient confirmation
  (6) show deleted items and allow for undelete with toggle
  (4) strike-through completed/deleted items (styling)
  (6) category pages (not really pages, just a show/hide trick)
  (7) ability to add/leave comments on item (this is not necessary, but could be a cool feature...)
  (9) drag and drop to arrange (seems like a cool idea, but could be difficult to figure out.)
